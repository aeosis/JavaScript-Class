Homework
========
1. (5 pts) Define a function that returns true if its argument is a palindrome, otherwise returns false. The function should work for strings and numbers. Verify the function with a few random examples and display the results. 
let myString = "alaina";
let char = myString.charAt(0);
let len = myString.length;
2. (7 pts) Write a function that takes two integers and returns their product. The product should be calculated with a loop using only addition.
3. (5 pts) Write a loop that displays squares of the integers from 0 to 100 inclusive (i.e. 0, 1, 4, 9 and etc.).
 
 for (let j = 1; j < 101; j++) {
	let n = j*j;
	echo(n);
	}
4. (3 pts) Do above, but instead of multiplication use the function defined in 2.
5. (23 pts) Do above, but use only a single loop and addition. Do not use multiplication or any helper functions for exponentiation.

P.S. Create the separate files for each assignment and homework and push to your fork. You can use sample.html as a template. echo function defined in helper.js file will display results in the html. -->
